# Advanced Clock Generation and Distribution Network

This project implements a comprehensive clocking architecture for multi-GHz SoC systems. It features clock generation, glitch-free switching, phase interpolation, power-aware gating, and robust clock domain crossing (CDC) protocols. All modules are written in Verilog HDL and are verified with testbenches.
